h1. Black Mac OS X

Black Mac OS X is a free, open-source SIMBL plugin created by Alex Zielenski. In a finished state it will provide a complete Mac OS X Snow Leopard theme and hopefully 10.7 Lion. "Shades of Gray for Snow Leopard":http://www.fif7y.com/themes-computers.html looks good with this window theme.

h3. Documentation

This is modified to do a few things.  1) I made the buttons green, this can be easily changed to any color and or back to stock in the XCODE project.   2) I added in a check for VM Fusion and Remote Desktop and prevent loading on those 2 apps.  (both would crash for me and I would rather them not skin and work than skin and crash)  3) I added a check for FINDER and removed the skin on the bottom bar so that TotalFinder skins correctly.  The problem is that a normal user who doesn't use total finder see's a incorrect bottom bar, but a user who DOES use total finder see's awesomeness.  If someone can figure out Total Finders bundle Identifier, I will add that instead of the Finder.
